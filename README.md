## üß† How It Works

- Uses Selenium to automate Google Maps search and extract business cards
- Parses business details with BeautifulSoup
- Uses Google Custom Search API to find official social media links
- Cleans and deduplicates data before saving

## ‚ö° Tips & Best Practices

- For best results, use specific queries (e.g., `cafes in Kumasi`)
- Increase "Max Results" for larger datasets, but note that Google Maps may limit results
- Use your own Google Custom Search API key for higher accuracy and quota

---

## üêû Troubleshooting

- **Missing modules?**  
  Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Chrome not found?**  
  Make sure Google Chrome is installed and up to date
- **API errors?**  
  Set your own Google API key and CSE ID in `extract_businesses.py`
