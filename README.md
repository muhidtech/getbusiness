## üîë Google Custom Search API Setup

To enable social media link extraction, you **must provide your own Google Custom Search API key and Search Engine ID**.

### How to Get Your API Key and CSE ID

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project (or select an existing one).

2. **Enable Custom Search API:**
   - In the Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
   - Search for **Custom Search API** and enable it for your project.

3. **Get Your API Key:**
   - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click **Create Credentials > API key**.
   - Copy your API key.

4. **Create a Custom Search Engine (CSE):**
   - Go to [Google Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all).
   - Click **Add** and enter any site (e.g., `facebook.com`) to create the engine.
   - After creation, go to the CSE control panel.
   - Under **Sites to search**, select **Search the entire web but emphasize included sites**.
   - Copy your **Search engine ID** (CSE ID) from the control panel.

5. **Add Your Keys to the Project:**
   - Open `extract_businesses.py`.
   - Find these lines near the top:
     ```python
     api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
     cse_id = "YOUR_CSE_ID"
     ```
   - Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` and `"YOUR_CSE_ID"` with your actual values.

   Example:
   ```python
   api_key = "AIzaSyD...yourkey..."
   cse_id = "0123456789abcdefg:abcde_fghij"
   ```

---

**Without your own API key and CSE ID, social media link extraction will not work.**  
If you hit quota errors, create a new key or enable billing for higher limits.

For more help, see the [Google Custom Search API docs](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/muhidtech/getbusiness.git

    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    _If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, install manually:_
    ```sh
    pip install selenium webdriver-manager beautifulsoup4 google-api-python-client
    ```

3. **(Optional) Set up your Google Custom Search API key**  
   Edit `extract_businesses.py` and set your own `api_key` and `cse_id` for best results.

## üö¶ Usage

### üñ•Ô∏è GUI Mode (Recommended)

```sh
python getbusinesses.py
```

- Enter your search query (e.g., `restaurants in Accra`)
- Set the maximum number of results
- Click **Start**
- Use **Pause**, **Resume**, **Stop**, **Show Saved**, **Export to CSV**, and **About** as needed

### üíª CLI Mode

```sh
python getbusinesses.py -t cli
```

**Commands:**
- `search` ‚Äî Start a new search (prompts for query and max results)
- `show` ‚Äî Display saved businesses
- `clear` ‚Äî Clear saved businesses
- `exit` ‚Äî Quit the CLI
- `help` ‚Äî Show all commands

---

## üì¶ Output

- **JSON:** All results are saved to `businesses.json`
- **CSV:** Export via GUI button or manually

**Sample JSON entry:**
```json
{
  "name": "Example Business",
  "address": "123 Main St, Accra",
  "phone": "+233 20 123 4567",
  "email": "info@example.com",
  "website": "https://example.com",

    "instagram": "https://instagram.com/example"
  }
}
```

## üß† How It Works

- Uses Selenium to automate Google Maps search and extract business cards
- Parses business details with BeautifulSoup
- Uses Google Custom Search API to find official social media links
- Cleans and deduplicates data before saving

---

## ‚ö° Tips & Best Practices

- For best results, use specific queries (e.g., `cafes in Kumasi`)
- Increase "Max Results" for larger datasets, but note that Google Maps may limit results
- Use your own Google Custom Search API key for higher accuracy and quota

---

## üêû Troubleshooting

- **Missing modules?**  
  Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Chrome not found?**  
  Make sure Google Chrome is installed and up to date
- **API errors?**  
  Set your own Google API key and CSE ID in `extract_businesses.py`
